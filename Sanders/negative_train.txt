@paulens It surprises me that @Apple throws up an error alert about authorizing, and there's no "Authorize this computer" button.
@Lisa_Marie1987 shhhh. the evil sith lords @apple may hear you ha!
FUCK YOU @apple DIE IN A FUCKING BLAZE INFERNO.
Oh, @apple. Steve obviously had nothing to do with iPhoto, as it's the perfect opposite of 'insanely great'. Get it fixed, please.
OMG @apple WHY THE FUCK DID YOU DELETE ALL MY MUSIC YOU DICKS
@ryanbaldwin @apple So in iTunes I go Store -&gt; Authorise… why doesn't it just auto-authorise it when I sign into iTunes? Grrrr...
Seriously - I have absolutely no offing clue what @Apple means by "authorization", nor how to do it.
Boy, could @apple make it any harder to put my purchased music from the cloud on to my new macbook pro? "You must authorize this computer…"
shit, shit, shit. IOS5 update ate all my apps, data and media just like @apple said it would. This is going to take some time to rebuild.
. @apple & @AT&T u cannot tell me there isn't at least 1 64GB iPhone 4S in LA or Vegas!! Give me a fucking break!!!!
Love @apple downloads. 4 hours and i-pad now wonky! #ripstevejobs #thenonsensepersists #neednewipadguide #fatfuckingchance

Gotta say the @Apple itouch iphone shuffle etc.. sound quality is AWFUL.. painfully crap. Its been a downgrade from @Sony sound quality wise
@bisquiat @Apple the upgrade just slows down my phone so much, it's stuck half the time. uch. thankfully no other damage. sucks for you :(
@Mayati I think @Apple didn't do such a thorough job with the step x steps for upgrade and move to iCloud. Now it's cost me mightily.
Hey @apple now I have iOS5 my iPhone doesn't include songs that are on compilation albums under the artist's name. #whaddupwitdat

…and only the first 23 images in my Photo Roll made it over? Seriously, @apple, how did you fuck this up so much?
@apple why does #iPhone4 plus #iOS5 equal half the battery life?
@apple why isn't my iTunes updating? I just wanna update my iPhone to IOS5!!! Then iTunes says that it needs to update to do it. Then fails!
Now @apple won't let me use credit on @iTunes unless I have a credit card. Should have told me when I redeemed the cards. Sound fair to you?
@amandbrar @apple Siri has worked for me less than 10% of the time. If service doesn't improve by Monday, I'm returning my iPhone 4S.
@azrael: RT @DavideGori: And again #MobileMe is down. Issues when syncing, accessing mail... is this a good premise for #iCloud? @Apple, ...
need @apple help!! installing new ios on #iphone4 and am stuck on the Find My iPhone screen :( i keep clicking next but it doesn't work
Bummer that @Apple #iCloud syncs on Windows only w/ Outlook (not Thunderbird) & IE (not Firefox, Chrome). #sadmac
@RonakKataria @apple you heard of testing before deploying updates. Difference between microsoft & apple: None
Disappointing visual merchandising, @apple. Simple, but lacks elegance. And sequence doesn't even tell us about #Siri. http://t.co/XV2q3gfi
has been on terminal hold with @apple support!  She must not be the only person having trouble with the new iphone and synching!
@apple thanks apple for ios 5 and losing all my contacts!
@apple give me my apps back!!!
@Apple #iOS5 NONSTOP DROPPED CALLS&MUTE BUTTON RANDOMLY ACTIVATING&PERSON CANT HEAR ME, PULL PHONE FROM EAR TO BE ON A "MOBILE ME" SCREEN
RT @tomcolontonio: Didn't it occur to @apple #apple that ppl share iTunes accounts amongst family's ????? Wtf!!!!
@tomcolontonio @apple #EPICFAIL
90 minutes after being at 100% my iPhone 4 (post #ios5 upgrade) has lost 40% of its charge and the @apple store folks are out of ideas.
So "cutting the cord" makes podcasts even harder to manage?!? No subscriptions! WTH, @Apple? http://t.co/LD2i871x #iOS5 (via @carrypad)
remember when people used to say "flat the fuck out!!" lol.. and their face while saying.... kindahow i feel about @apple
In less than an hour my post- #iOS5 iPhone has gone from 100% to 73% battery charge and the @apple store folks have no solution for me :(
Well @apple seems 2b screwing #iphone 4s resellars. They still dont have 4s. Yet were promised. Similar 2 Ma Bell's monopolistic prctices?
Also @EricGreenspan, don't forget @Apple stop closing the app store after each bloody purchase...
*sigh* @apple store seems stumped what to do about my catastrophically bad battery life after upgrading to #ios5
Hmmmm a lot of #Siri features don't work in Canada. Location and directions? Seriously @apple come on!
@apple, #siri can't connect to the network -- it's LESS useful that VoiceControl now... :(
@apple took my Siri and made it exclusive to iPhone 4S  #SoRude
total time on the phone with @apple: 1 hour 27 minutes. let's see how this goes.
Waited in line for nothing, fucking genius @Apple called an app for "John" not "jean" stop fucking up my name im not a French boy. #PCam ...
Dear @apple, One day you're going to release a version of iTunes that doesn't freeze more often than it works. One day.
It's been 24hrs since I reported @ups theft of my iPhone and @apple has done nothing. No return call as promised. Nothing.
This does not bode well. After charging all night, my @Apple iPhone 4S has 25% battery after only 3hr off charger with no calls & light use
Houston we have a problem!! My iPad has been restoring for 12+ hours after installing @apple IOS5. This can't be right....
#Siri went down for a little while last night. Come on @apple! Get your shit together on this launch!
@ford should have teamed up with @Apple instead of @microsoft to make this SYNC system in my new focus.  Car is sweet SYNC is #EpicFail
Installed io5 - fine on ipad but wiped wife's iPhone and restore from backup failed! #Bigtrouble #help @apple
